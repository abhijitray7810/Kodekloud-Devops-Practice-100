xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:
- a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 3. 
- b. Apache should serve on port 5004. 
- c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/official and /home/thor/games on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that official should work on the link http://localhost:5004/official/ and games should work on link http://localhost:5004/games/ on the mentioned app server.
- d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i. curl http://localhost:5004/official/ and curl http://localhost:5004/games/ ---
